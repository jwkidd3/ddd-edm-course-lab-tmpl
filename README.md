## Welcome to the Lab Environment!

You have now successfully acquired your own private copy of the lab exercises and instructions.
This is your sandbox, and you can feel free to make changes, commit and push those changes, etc.
You'll also find guidance here on how to complete the labs and run the tests. Happy coding!

_WARNING: While this is *your* repository, please don't make changes to any of the implemented code that already has passing tests during the labs.
If you break that code, you may not be able to successfully complete the labs._
